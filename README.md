# Deploying the OpenTelemetry Collector with your application
The OpenTelemetry (OTel) collector runs alongside your application to scrape logs and send telemetry data to LightFoot's observability backend storage. The OTel collector is configured as a docker container that can be spun up on the same machine as your application.

In the case where you are deploying your application, the OTel collector, and the backend storage all on the same machine, follow the instructions for **Deploying Locally** below. 

In the case where you are deploying your application and the OTel collector on the same machine, but the backend storage on another machine, follow the instructions for **Distributed Deployment** below.
